= Description
  A library for performing simple character rotation (i.e. Caesar Cipher)
  encryption. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

== Installation

  gem install crypt-rot13
   
= Synopsis
  require 'crypt/rot13'
  include Crypt

  str = Rot13.new("Hello World", 3) # Caesar cipher
  puts str # "Khoor Zruog"

= Notes
  Not unicode friendly. Only works on ASCII values 65-90 and 97-122.

  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13 for more on ROT13

= Acknowledgements
  Thanks go to Gaius Julius Caesar (d. 44 BC) for creating one of the first,
  and most simple, encryption schemes. Hail Caesar!
